# 42-ft_printf
## My own implementation of the C printf function

ft_printf is the first project of algorithm branch in the study program at School 42 (UNIT Factory). <br>
The main goal is to recode printf C function. 

All functions are created in accordance with Norm - the bunch of rules how code should be formatted.

**!NOTE** <br />
Because of 42 School norm requirements: <br />
* All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function <br />
* Each function can't have more then 25 lines of code <br />
* C++ style code commenting is forbidden <br />
* Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating. <br />

### General requirements from the task:

* You have to manage the following conversions: sSpdDioOuUxXcC <br>
* You must manage %% <br>
* You must manage the flags #0-+ and space <br>
* You must manage the minimum field-width <br>
* You must manage the precision <br>
* You must manage the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, et z. <br>

### My bonus part:
* More detailed flags management: * <br>
* Non-existing flags management: %b to print in binary
characters <br>
* Output in color <br>
* Possibility to work with different file descriptors <br>
