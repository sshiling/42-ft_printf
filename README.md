# 42-ft_printf
## My own implementation of the C printf function

ft_printf is the first project of algorithm branch in the study program at School 42 (UNIT Factory).
The main goal is to recode printf C function. 

### General requirements from the task:

• You have to manage the following conversions: sSpdDioOuUxXcC <br>
• You must manage %% <br>
• You must manage the flags #0-+ and space <br>
• You must manage the minimum field-width <br>
• You must manage the precision <br>
• You must manage the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, et z. <br>

### My bonus part:
• More detailed flags management: * <br>
• Non-existing flags management: %b to print in binary
characters <br>
• Output in color <br>
• Possibility to work with different file descriptors <br>
